# distraction-blocking-hosts-file
A hosts file designed to block distracting websites


This will be a collection of addictive sites that are a good idea to block if you want to focus. I will also provide a toool that lets you create a hosts file.

The generator tool will create a txt file for you, but won't copy it over your existing hosts file. You will do that manually. The reason for  this is that some antivirus software will go bezerk if they see an application messing with the hosts file.
